# EventsRouter

Events Router for [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com).   
Performs events routing between non-bounded instances, using the subscription model.   
Events Router parses game objects hierarchy automatically.   
You can subscribe to events without association with the sender and explicit setup actions  - using only the name of a sender game object. That saves time, looses coupling, fights with global warming...
